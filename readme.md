# Untapped contest for friends!

With the help of the public Untappd API we made this "game". 
By finding out from all your friends how many beers (including picture) there are, and how many badges there are, points are calculated. These are shown in a table in order from large to small. 

Untappd is fun, however, the game effect is still missing. Add this "widget" to your website. For example: http://www.kuuper.nl/

# Installation
Clone this project. Change your details in APIData.php. Then open index.php or paste the contents of index.php into your own file.
